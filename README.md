# Project Delve

Project Delve is a physical-first fantasy dungeon board game and a software reference implementation of its rules.

The physical tabletop game is the source of truth. The digital implementation exists to make the rules precise, testable, reproducible, and usable by different clients without introducing mechanics that only make sense on a computer.

## Design principles

- **Physical first.** Every game mechanic must be possible to perform and represent in the physical game.
- **Explicit rules.** Software implementation details must not silently become game rules.
- **Shared rules model.** Heroes and Monsters use the same underlying mechanics; their main distinction is who or what makes their decisions.
- **Engine-owned legality.** The rules engine computes legal choices. Human players, Monster Behavior, tests, simulations, or future AI choose only among those legal alternatives.
- **Separate state and presentation.** Physical State, Rules/Game State, and presentation are distinct concerns.
- **Deterministic where appropriate.** Non-random rules resolution should be reproducible. Physical randomness is represented explicitly through replaceable random providers.
- **Do not speculate.** Architecture and extension points should be introduced when actual rules or game content require them.

## Rules and constraints

[CONSTRAINTS.md](CONSTRAINTS.md) is the authoritative living specification for game-design decisions and implementation constraints that have been established so far.

Implementation work should read it before making assumptions about the rules.

If a required behavior is ambiguous or deliberately deferred in `CONSTRAINTS.md`, do not invent a rule merely to complete an implementation. Surface the ambiguity so the game design can be clarified first.

The README intentionally does not duplicate the detailed rules from `CONSTRAINTS.md`.

## Reference implementation

The reference implementation uses **C#/.NET**.

Its core rules engine is intended to be independent of UI, rendering, transport, and persistence technology. The game progresses as a persistent, stepwise state machine that can stop at stable decision points and later resume from serialized state.

Rules resolution produces authoritative Game State together with meaningful Rules/Domain Events. Clients may translate those events into text, animations, sounds, or other presentation without affecting the rules.

Decision Providers and Random Providers form explicit boundaries around agency and physical randomness. This allows the same engine to support human play, Monster Behavior, deterministic tests, simulations, and possible future AI-driven play.

## Current status

Project Delve now has a first executable reference-engine slice in `ProjectDelve.Engine`, with focused tests in `ProjectDelve.Engine.Tests`.

The slice resolves one Round at a time: Unit Type tokens are drawn without replacement, each group completes Bonus Action, Move, then Act, and the engine pauses at legal Unit, destination, and attack-target decisions. State contains the pending decision and can be serialized between steps. The Decision Provider selects from supplied candidates or returns `null` where doing nothing is legal; the Random Provider supplies token draws and physical die faces.

The first scenario uses 1×1 figures on Floor cells. Floor is enterable and does not block LOS. Movement respects walls, closed and open doors, friendly pass-through, hostile blocking, and the top → left → right → bottom shortest-path tie-break. Normal attacks use the defined Melee/range rules, Attack and Defence Dice, damage, death, and figure removal. A Random Provider returns the die symbols; its physical implementation must preserve the Attack Die's 3 Hit/3 Miss and Defence Die's 2 Block/4 Miss face distributions. `SideId` determines friendship independently of Unit Type or who supplies decisions. The engine rejects attack LOS involving featured edges or an intervening hostile Unit, whose LOS effects are still undecided.

Run the automated tests with `dotnet test ProjectDelve.sln`. The engine targets .NET 10 and has no UI or persistence adapter. The immediate goal remains to use executable scenarios to expose rule ambiguities and evolve from concrete game content.
